            <div class="content"><p>The second installment of the series brings us a decade back before events in the opening part took place.
A bunch of neighboring countries formed a Union, known as commonWealth, where technocracy was prevalent. It was a response to ever-growing economic challenges, changing social norms, and rising immigration. Globalization and rising automation have made life more insecure for the working and middle classes, with privileged people concentrating in the cities, leaving rural areas less habited.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>This is the first installment of &lsquo;Decaying Foundations&rsquo; series. It opens up in the world, which resembles ours very much. A parallel universe, if you will. The year is unknown, but judging from the technology and people, it is somewhere around 2020.
This short mix offers a glimpse in that world, where multiple contributing factors slowly introduce instability and chaos in various regions. It happens gradually, almost undetected. Seemingly random things tend to be discarded until it&rsquo;s clear that it definitely isn&rsquo;t.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>You might have stumbled upon this site by randomly browsing the internet, or following a link from one of the mixes accompanying this site and be wondering: &ldquo;ok, so what this is all about?&rdquo;
&lsquo;Decaying Foundations&rsquo; is a fusion of fictional stories and electronic music used to create and shape the alternative world, which resembles ours so much. A reflections from the (im)possible future, if you will. It&rsquo;s about the world and its everyday dystopias we&rsquo;re experiencing right now.</p></div>
