            <div class="content"><p>He was walking around the cluster of sparse bushes, growing in what seemed utterly random order.
A distant sound of the cascading waterfall was somewhat soothing. He liked coming down here and wandering around for hours, lost in the maze of his thoughts. He was thirstily breathing in all that air, even if now it was stale. Supporting infrastructure was already shut down; it was just a matter of time when everything else collapses on itself.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>The bleak morning light was seeping in through the molded metal grid of the old, abandoned drainage tube. It slowly diluted the darkness filling the vast cold and wet space. It wasn&rsquo;t the light that would trigger another cycle in your circadian rhythm system, gently nudging you to wake up. Above the ground, dull and repetitive surface expanded way beyond the grey line of the horizon in that grim light. The land ruptured in a few places and hasn&rsquo;t seen water for a long time.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>It&rsquo;s the darkest hour of the night. It&rsquo;s quiet, as it can get in the megapolis. From the bird&rsquo;s eye view, it seemed like a sleepy and inert organism; some movement over here, some bleep and whiz over there. The robot dog patrolling the area suddenly darts across the lightly illuminated garden to stop nearby giggling teenagers on a bench to start citing information about safety protocols. Still giggling, they slowly get up and move towards the illuminated gate.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>The second installment of the series brings us a decade back before events in the opening part took place.
A bunch of neighboring countries formed a Union, known as commonWealth, where technocracy was prevalent. It was a response to ever-growing economic challenges, changing social norms, and rising immigration. Globalization and rising automation have made life more insecure for the working and middle classes, with privileged people concentrating in the cities, leaving rural areas less habited.</p></div>

            <div class="content"><p>This is the first installment of &lsquo;Decaying Foundations&rsquo; series. It opens up in the world, which resembles ours very much. A parallel universe, if you will. The year is unknown, but judging from the technology and people, it is somewhere around 2020.
This short mix offers a glimpse in that world, where multiple contributing factors slowly introduce instability and chaos in various regions. It happens gradually, almost undetected. Seemingly random things tend to be discarded until it&rsquo;s clear that it definitely isn&rsquo;t.</p></div>
