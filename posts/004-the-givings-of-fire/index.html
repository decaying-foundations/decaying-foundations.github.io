          <div class="content-full"><p>He was walking around the vast cluster of several bushes, growing in what seemed utterly random order.</p>
<p>A distant sound of the cascading waterfall was somewhat soothing. He liked coming down here and wandering around for hours, lost in the maze of his thoughts. He was breathing in that air, even if now it was stale. Supporting infrastructure was already shut down; it was just a matter of time when everything else collapses on itself. &ldquo;It is just a matter of time,&rdquo;  - he muttered to himself, almost inaudibly.</p>
<p>Mentally he was already preparing for the journey back to the ground. It took a bit of time to pass all of the gates and checkpoints, crossing these vast and enormous spaces and complicated muddle of corridors, and then spending what seemed like an eternity in the high-speed elevator.</p>
<p>The lock of the first sluice doors clicked down, shutting the doors behind his back tightly. Gate just read his access profile, and the grey conduit lit in the pale green light.</p>
