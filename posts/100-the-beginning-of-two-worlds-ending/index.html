          <div class="content-full"><p>Adam was lying on the soft, comfy surface. It radiated warmth in slowly pulsing motions, mimicking the heart rate. He felt that he started to sink into the creamy texture - he knew the process was about to begin. Jaw unclenched, all muscles relaxed through the sweeping motion over the whole body, breathing becoming rare and shallow.</p>
<p>After a while, in a dark, gloomy mist, he starts seeing dots. One at first, joined by the second one a bit later. And third. Their shapes and sizes morph as they&rsquo;re slowly moving in the space, surrounded by the silky gloominess. Occasionally, their surfaces would touch each other, and they&rsquo;ll bounce off, moving in different directions.</p>
<p>Other patterns start to appear in that space, emerging from the darkness. There&rsquo;s a light coming from the bottom. Irregular bubbly figures start to dance in the void. More patterns emerge, and they begin to interact with each other at varying speeds. They jumped around and crashed into each other in unison, resulting in the bubble bursts, which would then bounce around until they would slow down. Sharp rays pierced the void illuminating everything. It&rsquo;s about to start anytime now.</p>
