          <div class="content-full"><p>Long years passed by. The eternity of collective suffering. Over time, the collective became less aware of its existence, while the weak links linking its cells gradually vanished away.</p>
<p>For over 300 years, everything succumbed and seemingly hindered. The world became weirdly still - at least on the surface. The only sure thing was that uneasy stillness in the air. But not for long. It took decades for the poisoned, scarred Earth to take a deep breath and start recovering, which seemed like an impossible thing to do at that time. But it was nature&rsquo;s way of slowly reclaiming what belonged to it, not the other way around. At first, wildlife was scarce and startled, but with the cruelest animal vanished off the surface, it slowly but firmly recovered. Although the fauna and flora still looked a bit differently in those devastated regions. Dreary plains and spooky leftovers of forests wheezed death. It took unimaginable amounts of time to undo the damage.</p>
<p>The furious climate cycles were still rolling across the globe, causing the living hell on the surface of Earth.</p>
<p>But things looked a bit differently below the surface &hellip;</p>
