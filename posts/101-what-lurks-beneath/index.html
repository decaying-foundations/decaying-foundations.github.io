          <div class="content-full"><p>The view was breathtaking, Adam thought, slowly preparing for another tour deep down below the surface. It&rsquo;s been more than a dozen trips already, but he was still astonished by this megastructure.</p>
<p>Ropes, lanterns, and water containers were double-checked as everyone understood the critical aspect of any gear failing amid transition down. It will take them hours to reach the first break-out room, where the First Camp was now established. Adam still remembered the first expedition when they successfully managed to open the big metal door, which unveiled another dark tunnel leading to another drop to the abyss. He couldn&rsquo;t explain how they managed to achieve the unlocking part; he felt unease about it. The memory was hazy.</p>
<p>The newly discovered cave segment went down almost vertically and was full of wells with small horizontal passages. There were so many of them; it felt like it was impossible to explore all of them.</p>
