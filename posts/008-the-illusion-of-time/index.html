          <div class="content-full"><p>It hurt where icy as hell surface was touching his skin. It felt like the waves of cold impulses were freely roaming through his skull. He couldn&rsquo;t move at all. After a few weeks of intense sensory overload, it was hard to tell whether any of this was happening.</p>
<p>At least the flash beams were gone now, and his eyes already started to adjust to the darkness.
It was one of those big rooms he was kept in, where it wasnæ† clear whether it&rsquo;s standalone or part of the more prominent structure. The walls and the floor were all smooth and cold surfaces, but he knew that they could hastily become unbearably hot as well.</p>
<p>Some distant noise in the dark. He couldn&rsquo;t tell whether these sounds were heard before. Or was his mind playing tricks? Torture, maybe? Well, at least that&rsquo;s expected.</p>
<p>Some of these sounds made him shiver, and his skin would immediately get goosebumps. These strange sounds from the mountains. He lost count of all occurrences spent wondering what was all about, most lurking near the Dead zone.</p>
<p>He started dozing off again &hellip;</p>
