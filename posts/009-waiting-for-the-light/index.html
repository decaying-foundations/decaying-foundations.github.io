          <div class="content-full"><p>A thick layer of grey dust covered everything. Even with the mask on your face, the eyes were red and itchy. That tingling feeling in your throat followed you everywhere after spending some time in these tunnels. This one was going down at a relatively steep angle, so you needed to be careful when descending further down. A light in front of you suddenly disappear from the field of vision, and everyone automatically halts. After a few moments, there&rsquo;s a signal to proceed further, and everyone starts to move down the shaft slowly again. The whole unit was moving at a slower than usual pace. It felt almost like any ordinary exploratory expedition, like myriads of others, except for that hum that followed you everywhere. And it felt that it&rsquo;s getting stronger and more intense as they were descending farther down into the dark guts of the mountain. The legends about this place didn&rsquo;t help it either.</p>
<p>The overhead light flickers a few times again and turns off, giving way to the darkness.</p>
