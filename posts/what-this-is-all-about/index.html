          <div class="content-full"><p>You might have stumbled upon this site by randomly browsing the internet, or following a link from one of the mixes accompanying this site and be wondering: &ldquo;ok, so what this is all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Decaying Foundations&rsquo;</strong> is a fusion of fictional stories and electronic music used to create and shape the alternative world, which resembles ours so much. A reflections from the (im)possible future, if you will. It&rsquo;s about the world and its everyday dystopias we&rsquo;re experiencing right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a coincidence - most of the fiction about the future is not about the future at all - the basis of fears, uncertainty, and challenges are from the present it&rsquo;s written in. Building imaginative worlds using a mixture of mechanisms is the exercise of understanding our own, sometimes in entirely new ways &hellip;</p>
<p>Every short story about events transpired in this oppressive world is accompanied by the sounds selected and mixed after the story is written. The particular strand of futurism in that world is the primary aspect of the musical aesthetic of selected sounds. All of the mixes and accompanying stories are exclusively published through the <a href="https://palanga.live"><strong>&ldquo;Palanga Street Radio&rdquo;</strong></a> platform.</p>
<p>One might find these stories uncomfortable - the only thing that can be promised is that it&rsquo;s not going to be an enjoyable, easy-listening experience. So, how the future of our world will look like?</p>
