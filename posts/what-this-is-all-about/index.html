          <div class="content-full"><p>You might have stumbled upon this site by randomly browsing the internet, or following a link from one of the mixes accompanying this site and been wondering: ok, so what this is all about?</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Decaying Foundations&rsquo;</strong> is a project dedicated to unveiling some of the problems our world is facing. It uses short fiction stories and electronic music to create and shape the fictional world, which resembles ours so much. A reflections from the (im)possible future, if you will. It is not a coincidence - pretty much all of the fiction about the future is not about the future at all - the basis of all the fears, uncertainty, and all the challenges how they&rsquo;re perceived at the time of the writing. It is about the world and its everyday dystopias we&rsquo;re experiencing right now.</p>
<p>Every short story about events transpired in the oppressive future is accompanied by the mix of sounds selected and recorded after the story is written. This particular strand of futurism is the primary aspect of the musical aesthetic of selected sounds.</p>
<p>One might find these mixes hard to listen - the only that can be promised is that this ride is not going to be a pleasant, easy listening experience.</p>
