          <div class="content-full"><p>The time after the Great Drone Wars was dreadful. In few years after that, everyone pretty much vanished from the surface. Lucky ones took the shelter or ran away as far as they could. Well, at least they tried. The ones who weren&rsquo;t that fortunate were condemned for the painful permanence on the surface.</p>
<p>Air was hot and still thick with the ashes, and there were no signs of it getting cooler anytime soon. Desolated plains and poisoned remainings of forests weren&rsquo;t suitable for living there for prolonged periods. After spending some time in there, you could swear that you hear steps somewhere behind you.</p>
<p>Occasionally, shortwave radio waves would bounce off the surface and ionosphere, traveling through the obliterated flatland.</p>
